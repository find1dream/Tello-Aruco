# Tello-Aruco
using Aruco to estimate the position of tello https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h3xuEerZMY
 
using cascade pid to control the position of tello(I'm sure it works well than usual pid)

the main file is /tellopy/compos/tellofly.py

for the librarys, you can install them by reading https://github.com/hanyazou/TelloPy

using tensorflow(I use the gpu version) to perform face tracking

my code is for my project, so it changes ofen, if you want to use some of it, the best way maybe by reading the code I wrote and try it in you own project.
