I will show you two types of installations: bottom-facing camera version and mirror version. 

## 1. Installation for bottom-facing camera
### 1.1 Tello with another camera.
#### 1.1.1 camera
This is the camera I used for this tutorial.

You can choose similar analog cameras, which also should work.

#### 1.1.2 source for camera
Here I just use the source from circuit board of Tello.

And then disasemble the drone.

Last, test the voltage, 3.667v is enough for the camera

I used a glue gun to fix the camera

Load the battery, and the red led turns on.

That's all for the Tello part
